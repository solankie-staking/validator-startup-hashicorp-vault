## About This Archive

This repository originally contained a script to start a Solana validator by pulling the private key securely from **HashiCorp Vault** and keeping it in memory—enhancing key management without writing secrets to disk.

While this approach remains valuable, all future development and improvements have been moved to the new repository linked above. This archive is preserved for historical reference only.
